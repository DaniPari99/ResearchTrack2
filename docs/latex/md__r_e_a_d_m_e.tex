The final assignment requires to write the code for moving a robot in the environment initially unknown. Three modalities for moving the robot are required\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the robot has to reach a goal chosen by the user
\item the robot is driven by the user through the keyboard
\item the robot is driven by the user with the assistence of a collision avoidence architecture
\end{DoxyItemize}

This is the final assignment\textquotesingle{}s environment visualized with Gazebo\+: 

Initially the robot does not have a map of the environment, but it can build it through the laser scanner and thanks to the {\bfseries{gmapping}} package. The final map built by the robot is visualized in Rviz as follows\+:

In order to launch different nodes with only a command I implemented a launch file called {\bfseries{final.\+launch}} that is the following\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<?xml version="1.0"?>}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{<launch>}
\DoxyCodeLine{    <include file="\$(find final\_assignment)/launch/simulation\_gmapping.launch" />}
\DoxyCodeLine{    <include file="\$(find final\_assignment)/launch/move\_base.launch" />}
\DoxyCodeLine{    <node pkg="final\_assignment" type="user\_interface" name="user\_interface" output="screen" required="true" launch-\/prefix="xterm -\/e"/>}
\DoxyCodeLine{    <node pkg="final\_assignment" type="server" name="server" output="screen" required="true" launch-\/prefix="xterm -\/e"/>}
\DoxyCodeLine{     <node pkg="teleop\_twist\_keyboard" type="teleop\_twist\_keyboard.py" name="teleop" output="screen" launch-\/prefix="xterm -\/e" respawn="true">}
\DoxyCodeLine{    <remap from="cmd\_vel" to="new\_cmd\_vel"/>}
\DoxyCodeLine{   </node>}
\DoxyCodeLine{</launch>}
\end{DoxyCode}


it contains 2 nested launch file\+: {\bfseries{simulation\+\_\+gmapping.\+launch}} and {\bfseries{move\+\_\+base.\+launch}} which respectively launch the simulation environment and provide some tools for moving the robot in the environment.

It can be launched with the command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ roslaunch final\_assignment final.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Project structure}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
 As we can see from this graph, we have 9 nodes overall, even if $\ast$$\ast$/user\+\_\+interface$\ast$$\ast$ and {\bfseries{gazebo\+\_\+gui}} are not relationed with nothing. I choose to remap $\ast$$\ast$/cmd\+\_\+vel$\ast$$\ast$ topic from /cmd\+\_\+vel to $\ast$$\ast$/new\+\_\+cmd\+\_\+vel$\ast$$\ast$ according to achieve the specification regarding the 3rd modality for driving the robot avoiding the obstacles. In this way the $\ast$$\ast$/server$\ast$$\ast$ node is subscribed to the remapped topic $\ast$$\ast$/new\+\_\+cmd\+\_\+vel$\ast$$\ast$ and can check if the current velocities imposed by the user can cause collisions. In this case the values of the velocities are modified and published to the actual $\ast$$\ast$/cmd\+\_\+vel$\ast$$\ast$ according to stop the robot in difficulty situations. $\ast$$\ast$/server$\ast$$\ast$ node is linked to $\ast$$\ast$/move\+\_\+base$\ast$$\ast$ according to publish on $\ast$$\ast$/move\+\_\+base/goal$\ast$$\ast$ the goal chosen by the user in the 1st modality; for this purpose I also implemented a subscriber to the topic $\ast$$\ast$/move\+\_\+base/feedback$\ast$$\ast$ according to get the real-\/time position of the robot and check if the goal is reain this case I have a publisher to the topic $\ast$$\ast$/move\+\_\+base/$\ast$$\ast$ for cancelling the current goal once is reached. $\ast$$\ast$/server$\ast$$\ast$ is also connected to $\ast$$\ast$/gazebo$\ast$$\ast$ for receiving the laser scanner data on $\ast$$\ast$/scan$\ast$$\ast$ topic.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Pseudo-\/code}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
The behaviour of the most important node of the assignment\+: {\bfseries{server}} can be summarize by the following pseudo-\/code\+:

Whenever the user types a correct command in the user\+\_\+interface shell the service\+Callback is executed\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{if command = 1}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    print "what target do you want to achieve?"}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    get from input keyboard the goal chosen}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    set the bool variable 'goal' to true}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    set the goal\_msg fields pos\_x and pos\_y with the chosen coordinates}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    publish goal\_msg on topic move\_base/goal}
\DoxyCodeLine{ }
\DoxyCodeLine{else if command = 2}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    set the bool variable manDrive to true}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    set collisionAvoidence variable to false}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{else if command = 3}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    set collisionAvoidence variable to true}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    set the bool variable manDrive to false}
\end{DoxyCode}


Whenever the user try to change the velocities from the teleop\+\_\+twist\+\_\+keyboard \textquotesingle{}get\+Vel\+Callback\textquotesingle{} is executed\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{if we are in the 1st modality}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    the keyboard is not considered}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{else if we are in the 2nd modality}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    the keyboard is considered and the velocities are published on topic /cmd\_vel}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{else if we are in the 3rd modality}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    the message is saved in a global variable and maybe it will be corrected by the collisionAvoidenceCallback before being published}
\end{DoxyCode}


Whenever the position of the robot changes \textquotesingle{}current\+Position\+Callback\textquotesingle{} is executed\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{if goal is set to true}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    get the current position of the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    calculate the distance between the goal and the robot position}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    if this distance is less than or equal to a threshold}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{        print "goal reached"}
\DoxyCodeLine{        }
\DoxyCodeLine{        cancel the goal}
\end{DoxyCode}


Whenever a message from laser\+Scan is received and we are in the 3rd modality \textquotesingle{}collision\+Avoidence\+Callback\textquotesingle{} is executed\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{divide the array 'ranges' returned by the LaserScan topic in 5 sector (right, front\_right, front, fron\_left, left) and fill them appropriately}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{if min\_front\_dist is less than a threshold}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    if linear velocity is greater than 0 and angular velocity is equal to zero}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{        stop the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{        }
\DoxyCodeLine{if min\_front\_left\_dist is less than a threshold}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    if linear velocity is greater than 0 and angular velocity is greater than zero}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{        stop the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{        }
\DoxyCodeLine{if min\_front\_right\_dist is less than or equal to a threshold}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    if linear velocity is greater than 0 and angular velocity is less than zero}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{        stop the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{        }
\DoxyCodeLine{if min\_left\_dist is less than or equal to a threshold}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    if linear velocity is equal to 0 and angular velocity is greater than zero}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{        stop the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{        }
\DoxyCodeLine{if min\_right\_dist is less than or equal to a threshold}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    if linear velocity is equal to 0 and angular velocity is less than zero}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{        stop the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{        }
\DoxyCodeLine{publish corrected velocity on topic /cmd\_vel}

\item it is not considered the case in which the user chooses a goal that is not reachable, so in this case the robot will move infinitely to search the target position as long as the user either changes goal or modality
\item in the case in which the user sends 2 or more targets one immediately after the other, the robot will try to reach the last one chosen
